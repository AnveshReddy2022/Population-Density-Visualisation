# Making crisp spike maps with R

This project creates a 3D visualization of the population density in Germany using the rayshader package. The code first downloads and unzips the population data for Germany. The data is stored in a GeoPackage file, which is a format that can be read by the sf package. The data contains the population density for each pixel in Germany.

The next step is to convert the population data into a raster image. This is done using the stars package. The raster image is then used to create a heightmap. A heightmap is a 2D image that represents the elevation of a surface. In this case, the heightmap represents the population density in Germany.

The heightmap is then used to create a 3D object. This is done using the rayshader package. The rayshader package uses a technique called raytracing to render 3D objects. Raytracing is a process of simulating the way that light interacts with objects in a 3D scene.

The final step is to render the 3D object. This is done using the render_highquality() function from the rayshader package. The render_highquality() function takes a number of arguments, including the filename of the output image, the width and height of the image, and the light settings.

The code could be improved by adding some additional features, such as:

The ability to choose a different projection for the map. This would allow the user to view the map in a different way, such as from a bird's-eye view.
The ability to change the colors used in the visualization. This would allow the user to customize the look of the visualization.
The ability to export the visualization to a different format, such as a video. This would allow the user to share the visualization with others.
Overall, the code is a good example of how to use the rayshader package to create 3D visualizations of spatial data. The code is well-commented, and it is easy to follow. The code could be improved by adding some additional features, but it is a good starting point for creating 3D visualizations of spatial data.
